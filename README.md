# My Cypress Automation

This project uses Cypress to automate the testing of a **login feature** and a **user update feature**. Cypress is a **JavaScript-based end-to-end testing framework** that allows developers to write and execute tests in a real browser.

## Installation

>  Make sure you have **Node.js** installed before proceeding 

```bash
npm install
```
Then, install Cypress:

```bash
npm install cypress
```

## Running the Tests

You can run the tests using one of the following methods:

```bash
# You open the Cypress UI
npx cypress open

# Run the automation by command line
npx cypress run
```
